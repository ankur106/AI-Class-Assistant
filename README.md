cd /RAG-elasticsearch

# Create virtual environment first with below command
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate #(for Mac/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate #(for Windows)

# Make an .env file and set OpenAI api key
OPENAI_API_KEY = your_api_key

# Install python libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run ingestion pipeline to add vectors in elasticsearch
cd ingestion_pipeline 
python elastic.ingestion.py
cd  ..


# run the FAST API backend
uvicorn app:app --reload


```
